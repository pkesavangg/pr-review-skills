name: update-mock
description: Update an existing mock class to match its protocol's current signature. Use when a protocol has changed (added/removed/renamed methods, changed parameters) and the mock is now out of date. Triggers: "update mock for X", "mock is outdated", "fix mock", "sync mock with protocol", or after a refactoring that changed protocol signatures.
---

Update an existing mock to match the current protocol definition.

The mock or protocol to update is: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

### 1 — Locate the Protocol and Mock

If `$ARGUMENTS` is a mock name (e.g. `MockEntryService`):
- Search for the mock: `rg -l "class MockEntryService" meAppTests -g '*.swift'`
- Read the mock file to find which protocol it conforms to
- Search for the protocol: `rg -l "protocol EntryServiceProtocol" meApp -g '*.swift'`

If `$ARGUMENTS` is a protocol name (e.g. `EntryServiceProtocol`):
- Search for the protocol: `rg -l "protocol EntryServiceProtocol" meApp -g '*.swift'`
- Derive mock name: `Mock<NameWithoutProtocolSuffix>` (e.g. `MockEntryService`)
- Search for the mock: `rg -l "class MockEntryService" meAppTests -g '*.swift'`

Read both files in parallel.

---

### 2 — Diff the Signatures

Compare protocol methods vs mock implementations:

**For each protocol method, check:**
- Does the mock have a matching implementation?
- Are parameter names, types, labels, and return types identical?
- Are `async`, `throws`, and `@MainActor` modifiers correct?

**Categorize changes needed:**
- **Added methods** — protocol has methods the mock doesn't implement
- **Removed methods** — mock has methods no longer in the protocol
- **Changed signatures** — method exists in both but parameters/return type differ

---

### 3 — Apply Updates

Follow the project's mock conventions (same as `/gen-mock-single`):

**For added methods:**
- Add the appropriate stub (`Result` for services, `Error?` for repositories)
- Add call tracking: `private(set) var <method>Calls = 0`
- Add argument capture: `private(set) var last<Arg>: <Type>?`
- Add the method implementation matching the mock pattern

**For removed methods:**
- Delete the stub, call tracking, argument capture, and implementation
- Do NOT leave commented-out code

**For changed signatures:**
- Update the stub type if the return type changed
- Update argument captures if parameters changed
- Update the method implementation

---

### 4 — Update Test Call Sites

Search for tests that use the updated mock:
```bash
rg -l "Mock<Name>" meAppTests -g '*.swift'
```

For each test file, check if `makeSUT()` or direct mock usage needs updating:
- Constructor parameter changes → update `makeSUT()`
- Removed stub properties → remove corresponding test setup lines
- Renamed methods → update test assertions
