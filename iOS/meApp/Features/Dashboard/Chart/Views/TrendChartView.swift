//  MOB-518 — v2 weight-graph engine (greenfield strangler rebuild).
//
//  The new STABLE `Chart`: one view identity for the life of the period, rendering straight from an
//  immutable `ChartModel`. No `.id` (so no teardown/rebuild on a y-settle — the S1 fix by construction),
//  no per-frame windowing (Swift Charts owns the native scroll over the full decimated series — S2/S10),
//  no caches. The y-axis animates in place on settle (the model is only rebuilt at scroll-end, never
//  per frame — see `WeightChartHost`).
//
//  V2 scope: line + points + adaptive y-axis + native scroll. Crosshair/selection, header average, and
//  the goal chip/line come in V4. Marks reuse the exact legacy styling (`DashboardChartStyleProvider`
//  colors, `.monotone`, period line width / point size, `ChartDomainSanitizer`).
//
//  MULTI-SERIES: `orderedSeriesNames`/`seriesPoints` already loop over N series; BPM/baby add reference
//  lines + percentile styling here once weight is signed off.
